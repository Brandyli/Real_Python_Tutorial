# Real_Python_Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to start exploring a dataset with the Pandas Python library. 
You can access specific rows and columns to tame even the largest of datasets. 
You will employ multiple techniques to prepare and clean your data, by specifying the data type of columns, 
dealing with missing values, and more. You will create queries, aggregations, and plots based on those.

Now you can:

Work with Series and DataFrame objects
Subset your data with .loc, .iloc, and the indexing operator
Answer questions with queries, grouping, and aggregation
Handle missing, invalid, and inconsistent data
Visualize your dataset in a Jupyter notebook
